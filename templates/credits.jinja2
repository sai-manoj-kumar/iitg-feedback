        This web application is done by <a href="{{url}}" target="_blank">Sai Manoj Kumar Yadlapati</a>,
        Computer Science. This app transforms the paper based feedback system to online based system.
        This app for now is being used for receiving feedback for the course of Data Mining. It ensures the
        anonymity of the students. Also it is the task of the application to restrict users from filling
        the form more than once. So, unique keys are generated by Administrator and distributes them.
